My team and I wanted to study how the nature of discourse within Civil War-era abolitionist publications compares to that of modern day anti-human trafficking organizations. This exploratory research was accomplished using topic modeling, a statistical technique used in natural language processing. By using techniques of machine learning to graph topics over time, we hoped to find trends that would lead to novel avenues of historical inquiry.

## Data and Methodology

We analyzed five Pre-Civil War era abolitionist publications, including Frederick Douglass’s The North Star and William Lloyd Garrison’s The Liberator. In addition to these, we selected publications from five modern anti-human trafficking organizations. Our initial corpus represents only a fraction of the dense archives available, but we believe our project has the potential to expand much further.

I systematically extracted a sample of issues from each digitized publication. The sample size for each publication depended on the relative density of the archive. Once I built our corpus of text files, I used the Machine Learning for Language Toolkit (MALLET) to generate topics for the publications. 

## Special Thanks

I would like to thank Dr. Ben Wright for his advice, direction, and support throughout this project.

I'd also like to thank you, the reader, for approaching our project with a critical yet understanding eye. We're certainly proud of the work I've done; however, I recognize its technical (and mathematical) shortcomings. I hope this project will act as an inspirational catalyst for even more rigorous analysis of this topic.

We took a lot of inspiration from Robert Nelson's project [Mining the Dispatch](http://dsl.richmond.edu/dispatch/pages/home), and Cameron Blevins's [Topic Modeling Martha Ballard's Diary](http://www.cameronblevins.org/posts/topic-modeling-martha-ballards-diary/). I definitely recommend that you check them out!
